## Install

```bash
npm install -g stagereview
```

Then add the skill to your agent:

```bash
npx skills add ReviewStage/stage-cli
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 24.11 or newer
- A Git repository to review
- An AI agent that supports skills
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated when reviewing GitHub pull requests

Stage runs locally and opens its review UI in your browser. It does not upload your source code.

## Uninstall

```bash
npx skills remove ReviewStage/stage-cli
npm uninstall -g stagereview
```

## Usage

In your AI agent, run:

```
/stage-chapters
```

This organizes your local changes into reviewable chapters and opens a browser UI. Everything happens on your machine.

Stage groups related changes into chapters, adds a prologue and risk context, and provides a
file-by-file review surface with inline comments. The UI also supports full-file previews,
image diffs, syntax themes, typography settings, continuous chapter review, and keyboard
navigation.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--base <ref>` | Base ref to diff against (default: auto-detect main/master) |
| `--compare <ref>` | Compare ref to diff against `--base` |
| `--ref <mode>` | Diff scope: `work` (staged + unstaged + untracked), `staged`, or `unstaged` (default: auto-detect) |
| `--pr <number-or-url>` | Review a GitHub pull request by number or URL (requires `gh`) |
| `--instructions <text>` | One-off instructions for chapter generation (up to 1000 characters; `prep` command) |

Examples:

```bash
# Review only staged changes
/stage-chapters --ref staged

# Diff against a specific branch
/stage-chapters --base feature-a

# Compare two branches
/stage-chapters main feature
/stage-chapters main..feature
/stage-chapters --base main --compare feature

# Review a teammate's PR by number or URL
/stage-chapters --pr 123
/stage-chapters --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

### Let your agent act on your comments

Leave comments on the diff in the Stage UI, then hand them to your coding agent:

```
/stage-resolve
```

The agent reads every open thread, makes the requested change (or answers the question), and
resolves the thread with a short summary. Its replies show up in the browser automatically with an
"Agent" badge. Pass the same refs or `--pr` you used for `/stage-chapters` so the agent looks at the
same diff.

Under the hood this uses `stagereview comments`, which works without the review server running:

```bash
stagereview comments list --status open --json      # threads for the current diff scope
stagereview comments show <threadId>                # one thread in full (ID or 6+ char prefix)
stagereview comments reply <threadId> --body "..."  # add a reply
stagereview comments resolve <threadId> --body "Fixed: ..."
stagereview comments reopen <threadId>
stagereview comments create --file src/foo.ts --line 12 --end-line 14 --body "..."
```

### Review a GitHub pull request

With `gh` authenticated and a GitHub `origin` remote configured, use `--pr` to review a pull
request without checking out its branch. Stage loads the PR's changes and exposes its review
timeline, comments, labels, viewed-file state, merge status, and stacked-PR navigation when
available. GitHub actions such as submitting comments, marking files viewed, and merging remain
subject to your GitHub permissions.

### Additional instructions

Use `.stageinstructions` in the repository root for persistent review guidance, such as project
conventions or areas that deserve extra attention. For a one-off request, pass
`--instructions` to `stagereview prep`:

```bash
echo "Pay special attention to backward compatibility." > .stageinstructions
stagereview prep --instructions "Focus on changes to the public API."
```

Both sources are included in the chapter-generation prompt; the one-off instructions apply only
to that run.

### `.stageignore`

Add a `.stageignore` file to your repo root to exclude files from the diff analysis. Uses `.gitignore`-style patterns, one per line:

```
# Build artifacts
build/**
dist/**

# Generated code
*.generated.ts

# But keep this one
!dist/important.js
```

Ignored files still appear in the "Other changes" chapter so nothing is silently hidden. Comments (`#`), blank lines, and negation patterns (`!`) are supported — last matching pattern wins.
